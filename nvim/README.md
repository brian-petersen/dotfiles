# Neovim Config

For further inspiration see https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/blob/master/init.lua

## To Do

- Configure Lua LS for neovim's lua api
- `gc` shortcuts for JSX/React -- doesn't work when commenting out in a component
  - neovim is suppose to do this automatically depending on the treesitter context
    but it seems to be hit and miss
